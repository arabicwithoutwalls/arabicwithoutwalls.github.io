Listen to the dialogue and then answer the questions below.  Remember that this is language practice, not a test.  You should not be overly concerned about a wrong answer.  These activities are designed with feedback to re-direct you in the event of an incorrect answer.  Consider the feedback and then listen to the dialogue again.  By returning to the dialogue, you will better internalize the language elements you missed previously and be less likely to miss them again.<br><br>
