          <p>In preparation for this section, please review hamzat al-wa Sl <span class="arabic_lg">هَمْزة الوَصل </span>, the sun letters and moon letters<span class="arabic_lg"> الحُروف الشَّمْسِيّة وَالحُروف القَمَرِيّة </span>in Unit 8 of <em>Alif Baa</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>(Audio of Arabic to be added) </strong></p>
          <p>This is an area that deserves great attention because:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>It helps you gain speed/fluency in speaking </li>
          <li>It helps you gain speed in reading both silently and aloud, and </li>
          <li>It helps improve your comprehension skills as you learn how to recognize where words end and where others begin. </li>
          </ol>          <p> There are five points to remember when pronouncing <span class="arabic_lg">الـ </span>in the middle of speech at this stage of your learning. The first two are covered in this lesson and the other three will be covered in the Pronunciation section of chapters 6 and 7.</p>
          <p class="header2"> 1. The “Linking” Rule </p>
          <p> In the middle of speech and in fast speech, a word starting with <span class="arabic_lg">الـ</span> usually sounds as if it were connected to the word preceding it. To achieve this effect, the word starting with <span class="arabic_lg">الـ </span>must be linked to the last vowel of the word that precedes it. The linking takes two forms depending on whether the letter immediately after<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ</span> is a moon letter or a sun letter . This process is sometimes also described in terms of elision, i.e., unless preceded by a pause or a period, <span class="arabic_lg">الـ</span> must be elided partially or totally. </p>
          <p> Examine the examples below and click on the Arabic to hear it pronounced.</p>
          <table width="70%" align="center" cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
              <th scope="row" bgcolor="#333333"><table width="100%"  cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
                <tr>
                  <td height="40" class="tablecellb"> <p align="center">Moon letter after<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>, e.g., <span class="arabic_lg">في الْبيت</span></p></td>
                </tr>
              </table></th>
            </tr>
          </table>          
          <p>In this example, <span class="arabic_lg">همزة الوصل</span> is elided, i.e., it becomes completely silent as you link the<span class="arabic_lg"> في </span>to the <span class="arabic_lg">لْـ </span>in<span class="arabic_lg">  الْبيت </span>.
          </p>
          <table width="70%" align="center" cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
              <th scope="row" bgcolor="#333333"><table width="100%"  cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">
                <tr>
                  <td height="40" class="tablecellb"> <p align="center"> Sun letter after<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>, e.g., <span class="arabic_lg">في الشَّارع</span></p></td>
                </tr>
              </table></th>
            </tr>
          </table> 
		  
		  <p> In this example the whole of the<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>is elided, i.e., the whole <span class="arabic_lg">الـ</span> becomes completely silent. In this case, you go straight from the last vowel preceding the<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ</span> to the first (sun) letter that follows it. <span class="arabic_lg">الـ</span> is elided altogether.</p>
          <p> Remember that when<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>is at the beginning of a sentence or after a pause, the linking rule does not apply. The hamza at the beginning of the<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>needs to be pronounced as an<span class="arabic_lg"> أ </span>with a <span class="arabic_lg">فَتْحة </span>(i.e., as “a”). Listen to the hamza of the <span class="arabic_lg">الـ </span>in the following examples. </p>
           <table width="70%" align="center" cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
              <th scope="row" bgcolor="#333333"><table width="100%"  cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">

		   <p> As you know, the end of every word in Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic normally carries one of three vowels indicating the grammatical role that that word plays in the sentence (<span class="arabic_lg">كَسْرة/ضَمَّة/فَتْحةَ    َ /  ُ/</span>). It is that final vowel that is usually used in applying the linking or elision rule. Although at this stage in the course you are not yet ready to determine what the correct grammatical vowels are for every word you use, rules 2-5 will offer you strategies for greatly improving your fluency in speaking and reading aloud. You will learn in this chapter and chapters 6 and 7 how to apply the linking rule to a large group of words that you know: feminine nouns, verbs, prepositions, and words following prepositions. </p>
          <p> Whenever you listen to authentic speech, pay attention to the way words definite with<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ</span> blend in with the words that precede them. Practice consciously listening for where a word ends and where the following definite word begins. Definite words starting with sun letters tend to be the hardest to detect because you do not hear the<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ</span> at all. </p>
          <p> You will learn to apply the linking rule to the remaining word categories when you learn how to determine their grammatical endings. For now concentrate on practicing to use and recognize rules 2-5.</p>
          <p> <span class="header2">2. The Silent</span><span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span><span class="header2">“taa marbuuTa” Rule </span></p>
          <p> When <span class="arabic_lg">الـ </span>is preceded by<span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span>“taa marbuuTa” that is not in an iDaafa, you can normally choose to leave the<span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span>silent or add the grammatically determined vowel to the <span class="arabic_lg">ةَ/ ةُ / ةِ) ة )</span>. So far, we have been leaving the<span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span>silent. To apply the linking rule, you will need to link the<span class="arabic_lg">(  َ ) فَتْحة</span> that always precedes the<span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span>within the word to either the<span class="arabic_lg"> لـْ </span>in the<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>or the sun letter immediately following the<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ</span> (depending on whether you are dealing with a moon letter or a sun letter respectively, as explained above). </p>
          <p> Examine the examples below and click on the Arabic to hear it pronounced. </p>
          <table width="70%" align="center" cellpadding="0"  cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
              <th scope="row" bgcolor="#333333"><table width="100%"  cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3">

              </table></th>
            </tr>
          </table>          <p>In example 1, you link the<span class="arabic_lg"> رَ </span>to the<span class="arabic_lg"> لـْ </span>, eliding<span class="arabic_lg"> همزة الوصل </span>. </p>
          <p> In example 2, however, you link<span class="arabic_lg"> رَ </span>directly to<span class="arabic_lg"> صـَّ</span>, eliding the whole of the<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>. </p>
          <p> From now on, always keep an eye on words beginning with<span class="arabic_lg"> الـ </span>that are coming up in your speech or in the text  that you are reading and try to apply this rule until it starts to come naturally. </p>
          <p> Remember that in an<span class="arabic_lg"> إضافة </span>the<span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span>“taa marbuuTa” is always pronounced, i.e., is not silent, unless it occurs in the last term of the<span class="arabic_lg"> إضافة</span>.</p>
          <p class="header2"> Practice </p>
          <p> Now apply the linking rule and the silent<span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span>rule as you practice reading aloud the following sentences. Remember that when <span class="arabic_lg">الـ </span>is at the beginning of a sentence or after a pause, the linking rule and therefore the silent<span class="arabic_lg"> ة </span>rule do not apply. </p>
          <p> When you are ready, send all sentences as a sound file to your instructor.</p>
