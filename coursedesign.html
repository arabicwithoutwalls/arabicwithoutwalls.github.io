            <span class="style1"><em>Arabic Without Walls</em> includes the same course content as  Arabic 1A/1B, delivered in an online format.   The new course format contains materials for three course content  components:  (1) <em>Al-Kitaab</em> and <em>Alif Baa </em>(Kristen Brustad, Mahmoud Al-Batal and  Abbas Al-Tonsi, 2004), (2) QuickTime Movie Interviews, and (3) expanded  cultural presentations and activities not available in <em>Al-Kitaab</em>. While each component may stand by  itself and therefore may be studied independently, the three are designed to  complement each other in <em>Arabic Without Walls</em>. The course syllabus helps students  toggle between the textbooks, the DVDs, the Web materials, and the sound/chat  activities, as they proceed through a given chapter.  Most of the online activities give students  immediate feedback on their answers and send a record of the results to the  instructor (i.e. they are SCORM compliant).   Other more open-ended activities will be performed using the chat  program. </span></p>

          <ol class="style1">
            <li class="style1"><strong>Al-Kitaab:</strong><a name="k"></a>The <em>Al-Kitaa</em>b component refers to computer-based activities  designed specifically for the distance learner to facilitate use of the  assigned textbooks (Alif-Baa and Al-KitaabPart 1) used in traditional  classrooms in most U.S. college programs. Both textbooks are essential for AWW  and are currently used by regular UC Berkeley Arabic students. The Syllabus  button allows students to navigate your way through both textbooks and the  computer assisted activities presented under Al-Kitaab. These activities were  carefully designed to address questions that traditionally answered in class by  the teacher and to cover the supplementary materials that Berkeley student  usually receive. In the syllabus, the textbooks are referred to as AB and AK  for short. The Al-Kitaab section of AWW is divided into seven main areas of  study and quizes:

          <li class="style1"><strong>Interviews:</strong><a name="I"></a>
            QT Movie interviews with Arabic  speakers offering further listening and cultural input. The interviews expand  the distant learner's opportunity to hear Modern Standard Arabic spoken in a  sociolinguistic context that warrants the use of this, mainly, written variety  of Arabic and get acquainted with a diverse group of individuals from the Arab  world. The activities in this section (Interviews button on left hand side  menu) focus particularly on strengthening the distant learner's listening and  speaking skills by offering further opportunity to hear materials presented in  the Al-Kitaab section used by fluent speakers of Modern Standard Arabic. The  video interviews serve as models of the language that the student may use in  conversation with the instructor or with distant peers in the Chat activity.<br>
          </li>
          <li class="style1">              <strong>Culture:<a name="C"></a> </strong>
            This cultural-linguistic section is  intended to provide an informative and engaging context for learning Arabic.  This thematically organized section contextualizes the language for the distant  learners and raises their awareness of various, selected, cultural aspects of  the Arab world that regular Berkeley students may access when attending classes  or lectures in Near Eastern studies, history, literature, linguistics or  anthropology. In addition, this section enriches the distant learners' Arabic  vocabulary by introducing key contextualized Arabic words of relevance to the  topics addressed.</li>
          <li class="style1"> <strong>Chat</strong>:   In addition, all students will chat in Arabic on a daily basis with  their instructors and virtual classmates using a synchronous sound/text  exchange program.  Two sound/text chat  programs are being evaluated at present, Wimba and Breeze, and the most Arabic  friendly interface will be selected.  All  online materials are packaged using MOODLE, a course management system that  provides an Arabic interface and Arabic-enabled Wiki (asynchronous writing  space/bulletin board).</li>
