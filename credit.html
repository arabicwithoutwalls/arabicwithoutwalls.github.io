          <p>The  UC Consortium for Language Learning &amp; Teaching was established in 2000 by  the UC Office of the President and the Executive Vice-Chancellors of all the  system’s campuses. One of the Consortium’s principal charges is to extend  student access to the less commonly taught languages since the majority of campuses  in the system cannot afford and do not intend to provide them (e.g. Arabic,  Farsi, Punjabi, Hindi/Urdu, Swahili). <em>Arabic  Without Walls</em> constitutes the first instantiation of a framework to offer  credit-bearing, distance-learning first-year courses in languages of crucial  importance to UC education. The mechanisms for cross-registration in  distance-taught courses were approved through Senate Regulation 544 perhaps  provide a hard copy of the regulation In the packet? (i.e. “simultaneous” or  concurrent enrollment on another campus from the home campus).  In June 2004, the UC Education Policy  Committee not only endorsed the use of new technological tools to distribute  the curriculum at a distance, but also encouraged and supported distance  learning as one of the primary means by which students can concurrently enroll  in courses on another campus.  </p>
          <p>The  present request to the UCB campus is to seek approval for the existing Arabic  1A/1B curriculum to also be taught in a distance-learning format (Arabic 1A-/1B-V[irtual])  in addition to the traditional classroom format.  The new format for the existing courses would  be open for enrollment to students at other UC campuses via concurrent  enrollment (SR #544). The Berkeley  campus may exercise its option to include or exclude students from their own  campus from enrolling in Arabic 1A-/1B-V[irtual].</p>

 <p><strong><u>U.S.</u></strong><strong><u> Department of Education Grant</u></strong>: </p>
 <p>In  collaboration with the National Middle East Language  Resource Center,  at Brigham Young University,  the UC Consortium applied for and was awarded a three-year $452,622 grant to  design and implement <em>Arabic Without Walls</em>.  Then UC Berkeley Dean Ralph Hexter authored the principal letter of support for  the grant, accompanied by a letter from the chair of the UCB Near Eastern  Studies Department, with the understanding that the course would be produced  and delivered by Berkeley.  Dr. Sonia S’hiri has received course release and GSR funding to design the  course and develop the online lessons. The components of the online course are  nearing completion with an anticipated launch date for Fall Semester,  2006.  The FIPSE grant will fund four TAs  for the online course in academic year 2006-2007 and will offer a summer  training program in 2006 for all UC Arabic TAs (May 30-June 4, 2006) that will include  specific training for the instructors of the online delivery by leading Arabist  and <em>Al-Kitaab</em> textbook series  co-author, Prof. Mahmoud Al-Batal. </p>
