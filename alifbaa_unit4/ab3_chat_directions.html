<p class="header1">Partner Practice, Lesson C</p>

<p class="header2">Directions for Partner A</p>
<p><u>Conversation 1</u></p>
<p>You will participate in two short conversations with your partner. For the first conversation, you will be the 
initiator. As such, you will play the role of the visiting grandparent of a friend of your partner. Your partner has gone 
to his/her friend's house to visit and you answer the door. Complete the following tasks.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Greet your grandchild's visitor.</li>
	<li>Welcome him/her inside.</li>
	<li>Ask the person his/her name. (Do not offer yours <u>yet</u>.)</li>
	<li>Express pleasure at having met your grandchild's friend.</li>
	<li>Don't initiate anything from this point on, except to respond to questions asked you.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Conversation 2</u></p>
<p>Your partner will initiate this conversation. It is a conversation between you and your brother's friend. You have met 
the friend previously and recognize him/her by face but have forgotten his/her name. (Your brother, by the way, is named 
Ahmed.) Respond to any statements and questions made, as well as complete the tasks listed below.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sometime throughout the conversation, feign confusion and ask your brother's friend what something he/she has said means.</li>
	<li>When asked your name, find out your brother's friend's name as well.</li>
	<li>Your brother's friend will offer you a piece of candy. Take it and say "thank you."</li>
</ol>

<p class="header2">Directions for Partner B</p>
<p><u>Conversation 1</u></p>
<p>You will participate in two short conversations with your partner. For the first conversation, your partner will be 
the initiator and will play the role of your friend's visiting grandparent. You have gone to your friend's house to visit 
and he/she unexpectedly answers the door. As you will be speaking with someone whom you do not know well and is significantly 
older than you, show respect by being formal in your speech.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Knock on the door and wait for it to be answered.</li>
	<li>Respond to any greetings offered, as well as showing gratitude for entrance into the home.</li>
	<li>Once inside, let the grandparent start the conversation. Even if you do understand the first question asked you, pretend that you do not and request him/her to <u>please</u> say it again for you.</li>
	<li>When asked your name, respond and ask for the grandparent's name.</li>
	<li>From here on out, the conversation turns awkwardly silent. Keep it going by asking how the grandparent is doing.</li>
	<li>Imagine that your friend has entered the room, and say "goodbye."</li>
</ol>
<p><u>Conversation 2</u></p>
<p>In the second conversation, you will play the role of initiator. This is a conversation between you and a friend's 
sibling, whom you have met previously and recognize by face but have forgotten his/her name. (Your friend, by the way, is 
named Ahmed.)</p>
<ol>
	<li>Greet your friend's sibling according to the time of day.</li>
	<li>Act like you are trying to remember his/her name but have forgotten. Ask the sibling for his/her name <u>again</u>.</li>
	<li>Next ask how the sibling is doing. Later ask how Ahmed is doing. (Need help with formulating this question? If so, <a href="ab3_culture.html">click here</a>.)</li>
	<li>Pretend you are getting out a package of candy from your bag. You notice your friend's sibling is watching. Since it is considered rude in Arabic culture to eat in from of others without offering them something to eat as well, correct your mistake and hold out a piece of candy to your friend's sibling. Offer it to him/her by saying "please, go ahead."</li>
	<li>If your offer is accepted and you are thanked, say "you're welcome."</li>
	<li>Say "goodbye."</li>
</ol>
