            <span class="style1">In collaboration with the National Middle  East Language Resource Center at Brigham Young University, the <strong><a href="#uc"><font color="#FFFFFF">UC Consortium for Language Learning  &amp; Teaching</font></a></strong> applied for and was awarded in 2003 a three-year  $452,622 FIPSE grant from the Department of Education (#P116B030526) to design  and implement <em>Arabic Without Walls</em>,  an online first-year Arabic course offered through UC Berkeley. Students enroll  in the UC Berkeley online Arabic course from other UC campuses through  “simultaneous” enrollment <strong>(<a href="#senate"><font color="#FFFFFF">Senate  Regulation 544</font></a></strong>:  i.e., concurrent  enrollment on another campus from the home campus). </span></p>
          <p class="style1">The <em>Arabic Without Walls</em> materials were  designed to accompany <em>Al-Kitaab</em>, the  most popular Arabic textbook (Georgetown University Press, 2004), and to serve  students in both traditional and online learning environments.   The online materials offer (1) additional  listening and writing practice for materials in <em>Al-Kitaab</em>, (2) video interviews with Arabic-speaking people with  follow-up activities, (3) additional cultural materials not available in the  textbook, and (4) an electronic forum where students can chat in Arabic in real  time through both voice (voice-overIP) and text.  </p>
          <p class="style1">The  online Arabic curriculum represents the equivalent of UC Berkeley’s Elementary  Arabic 1A-1B delivered in a distance-learning format. This distance-learning  course meets the same objectives and emphasizes the functional use of Arabic in  the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The  authentic audio, video, and reading materials in current usage in the classroom  have been expanded and enriched to provide even more culture- and content-based  instructional material for the distance student, including exposure to a  diverse presentation of cultural characteristics found in the Arabic speaking  world.  Creativity with the language  remains a central component of this Web-format Elementary Arabic course. Via a  bi-modal sound/text chat program, students will interact among themselves and  with the instructor or TAs on a daily basis, replicating live classroom  conversation practice. Final examinations for the online course will be  proctored at the language laboratories of the students’ home campuses.<br>

            <a name="uc"></a>The<u> <strong>UC Consortium for Language Learning &amp; Teaching</strong></u> (<a href="http://uccllt.ucdavis.edu/"><font color="#FFFFFF">http://uccllt.ucdavis.edu</font></a>) was  established in 2000 by the UC Office of the President and the Executive  Vice-Chancellors of all the system’s campuses. One of the Consortium’s  principal charges is to extend student access to the less commonly taught  languages since the majority of campuses in the system cannot afford and do not  intend to provide them (e.g. Arabic, Farsi, Punjabi, Hindi/Urdu, Swahili).  Arabic Without Walls constitutes the first instantiation of a framework to  offer credit-bearing, distance-learning first-year courses in languages of  crucial importance to UC education.</p>
          <p class="style1"><a name="senate" id="senate"></a>In June 2004, the UC Education Policy  Committee not only endorsed the use of new technological tools to distribute  the curriculum at a distance but also encouraged and supported distance  learning as one of the prime means by which students can enroll in courses  through SR #544.</p></td>
